# simulated-annealing-to-color-a-planar-graph

A planar graph is a graph where 2 edges that cross, can be drawn so that they donâ€™t cross.

The coloring criteria requires that any neighboring nodes must have distinct color. 

It has been proven that this coloring scheme exists (with at least 4 colors) for any planar graph.
